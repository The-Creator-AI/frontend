    "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Users should be able to switch between light and dark themes.",
        "The theme preference should be saved in local storage so that it persists across sessions.",
        "The frontend application should dynamically update its appearance based on the selected theme.",
        "The theme switching mechanism should be easy to use, potentially including a button or toggle switch in the UI.",
        "The theme should apply to all components and UI elements, ensuring consistency in appearance.",
        "The theme should respect user preferences and load the previously saved theme on page load."
